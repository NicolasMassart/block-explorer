# Mix Block Explorer

The MIX block explorer works with any Ethereum-based blockchains. It is built in [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) with [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) and uses the [Web3 API](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js).

## Installation
1. Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) (if you havenâ€™t already)
2. Run `yarn` to install the project dependencies
3. `yarn start` runs the app on `localhost:3000`
4. To run the test suite enter `yarn test`

There is no blockchain setup needed as this block explorer connects to the [MIX blockchain](https://www.mix-blockchain.org) as fallback. If you want you can use a Web3 browser extension (such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)) to connect to other blockchains.
